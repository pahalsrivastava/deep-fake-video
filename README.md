# Deepfake Video Detector

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deepfake video detector using a pre-trained VGG16 model in TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features

- Trains a deepfake detector using a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network.
- Evaluates the trained model's accuracy on a test set of video frames.
- Provides scripts for training (`train.py`) and evaluation (`model.py`).

## Dependencies

- Python
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Scikit-learn

Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
