Deepfake Video Detector
This project demonstrates how to build and train a deepfake video detector using a pre-trained VGG16 model in TensorFlow/Keras.

Overview
Deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it crucial to develop tools to detect manipulated videos. This project uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between authentic and deepfake videos based on frames extracted from the videos.

Features
Trains a deepfake detector using a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network.
Evaluates the trained model's accuracy on a test set of video frames.
Provides scripts for training (train_deepfake_detector.py) and evaluation (evaluate_deepfake_detector.py).
Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
OpenCV (cv2)
Scikit-learn
Install dependencies using requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation
Place authentic video frames in data/authentic/.
Place deepfake video frames in data/deepfake/.
Ensure proper labeling and organization of frames.
Usage
Training the Model:

Run the training script to train the deepfake detector model:

bash
Copy code
python train_deepfake_detector.py
Evaluating the Model:

Run the evaluation script to test the model's accuracy on a separate test set:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_deepfake_detector.py
Customization:

Adjust model architecture (train_deepfake_detector.py) and preprocessing (evaluate_deepfake_detector.py) as needed.
Modify paths, parameters, and hyperparameters to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
